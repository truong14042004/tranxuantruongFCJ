# Video Sharing Platform

## 1.Executive Summary

This proposal outlines the development of a scalable Video Sharing Platform leveraging AWS cloud services. The platform will enable users to upload, stream, and share video content with features including user authentication, content management, and real-time video streaming.

Key objectives:

- Build a secure, scalable video sharing platform
- Implement user authentication and authorization
- Provide high-quality video streaming capabilities
- Ensure cost-effective infrastructure management
- Deliver seamless user experience across devices

The solution utilizes AWS services including Amplify for frontend hosting, Cognito for authentication, S3 for storage, CloudFront for content delivery, and Interactive Video Service for streaming capabilities.

## 2.Problem Statement

### What's the Problem?

Current video sharing solutions face several challenges:

- High infrastructure costs for video storage and streaming
- Complex setup and maintenance requirements
- Limited scalability during peak usage
- Security vulnerabilities in user authentication
- Poor video quality and buffering issues
- Lack of real-time analytics and monitoring

### The Solution

Our AWS-based video sharing platform addresses these challenges by:

- Leveraging AWS's cost-effective, pay-as-you-use pricing model
- Utilizing managed services to reduce operational overhead
- Implementing auto-scaling capabilities for handling traffic spikes
- Providing enterprise-grade security through AWS Cognito and WAF
- Delivering high-quality video streaming via Amazon IVS and CloudFront
- Offering comprehensive monitoring and analytics through CloudWatch

### Benefits and Return on Investment

**Cost Savings:**

- 40-60% reduction in infrastructure costs compared to traditional hosting
- No upfront hardware investments required
- Pay-per-use model optimizes operational expenses

**Performance Improvements:**

- 99.9% uptime availability
