## Powering European Innovation: Partner Solutions for AWS European Sovereign Cloud

*by Max Peterson on 02 JUL 2025*  
*In: APN Launches, Partner Solutions*

### Author: Max Peterson, VP AWS Sovereign Cloud

As we get closer to launching the **AWS European Sovereign Cloud**—a new, independent cloud for Europe—we’re excited to see our partner ecosystem continue to grow. The AWS European Sovereign Cloud will be located and operated entirely within the European Union (EU), offering customers the security, availability, and performance of today’s AWS, with added capabilities tailored to evolving EU data-sovereignty requirements.

Today, we’re pleased to highlight a broadened set of partner solutions being built for AWS European Sovereign Cloud. These complement the strong portfolio **announced last November** from leading names like Adobe, Cisco, Dedalus, Esri, Genesys, GitLab, Mendix, Pega, Trend Micro, and Wiz. Together they form a comprehensive ecosystem that helps European organizations innovate with confidence.

The diversity of these solutions underscores the strong momentum across Europe and our commitment to meet changing data-sovereignty needs. From data analytics and security to industry-specific applications, APN partners are delivering tools and services designed to **comply with EU data-sovereignty requirements**. These solutions inherit the strict security standards and **operational independence** of the AWS European Sovereign Cloud, while adding features focused on data sovereignty.

## Expanding Solution Categories and Highlights

### Data & Analytics Platforms

These solutions help organizations unlock data while keeping full control over sovereignty, offering powerful analytics with EU-specific governance. Partners are building platforms that let customers process, store, and analyze data while adhering to EU regulations.

**ClickHouse** is collaborating to deliver real-time analytics on AWS European Sovereign Cloud, handling billions of records monthly with millisecond latency while meeting strict data-sovereignty needs. It enables advanced analytics and Generative AI while keeping data stored and processed within Europe, complying with GDPR and local rules.

**Cloudera** is developing a sovereignty-by-design data platform so customers can keep data and metadata entirely within EU borders, ideal for regulated industries and the public sector that must ensure integrity and compliance in Europe.

**MongoDB** plans to bring its unified document database platform, simplifying data-driven app development with flexible models, developer-friendly querying, and scalability that aligns with EU data-sovereignty demands.

**Reltio** is extending its cloud-native data unification platform, Reltio Data Cloud, to the AWS European Sovereign Cloud. The agentic data fabric delivers real-time, trusted, rich-context data, supporting seamless operations, real-time analytics, and intelligent automation—all with EU data-sovereignty compliance. With Reltio Intelligent Data Graph, customers get a comprehensive, millisecond view across customers, products, and suppliers to boost efficiency and experiences.

**Snowflake** plans to bring its AI & Data Cloud to AWS European Sovereign Cloud, helping enterprises meet evolving European data-sovereignty and regulatory needs, with comprehensive data governance and security for sensitive data and metadata in a strictly compliant environment.

### Observability & Process Management

Solutions here provide deep visibility into applications, infrastructure, and business processes while keeping all customer data and metadata within the EU. Partners combine robust monitoring with process optimization and data-residency controls.

**ARIS** is building a full Process Intelligence suite to identify, analyze, simulate, optimize, and control business processes within the EU, including process mining and modeling, cost control, process governance, and compliance.

**d.velop** plans to deploy its enterprise-grade Document Management System (DMS) to manage and store documents with compliant data protection, optimize workflows, and ensure adherence to strict legal standards.

**Sumo Logic** is creating a unified, AI-powered cloud-native log analytics platform, giving DevSecOps teams a single data source for reliability, security, and cloud insights—while keeping data sovereign in the EU.

### Integration, DevOps & Migration

These tools support secure, compliant software development, deployment, integration, and migration while preserving operational sovereignty in the EU—covering the full modernization lifecycle with data-sovereignty at the center.

**Boomi** is developing a dedicated version of Boomi Enterprise Platform, an AI-driven integration and automation platform connecting apps, APIs, data, and AI agents, reinforcing metadata security and EU data sovereignty.

**Eficode** is building Eficode ROOT for AWS European Sovereign Cloud, combining a managed development platform with DevOps expertise to run secure, scalable, compliant environments.

**Trianz** is creating Concierto, a highly automated, no-code SaaS platform to accelerate end-to-end cloud migration and modernization with intelligent automation, hybrid-cloud operations, FinOps, optimization, and auto-remediation via a single pane of glass—reducing technical debt while maintaining control and sovereignty.

### AI & Machine Learning

AI/ML solutions process and analyze data within the EU, enabling innovation while maintaining data sovereignty.

**Mistral AI** plans to offer its models and applications, including Le Chat Enterprise, on AWS European Sovereign Cloud—providing secure enterprise search and custom AI agents to automate tasks across multiple data sources, with compliance for high-security sectors such as defense, public sector, and financial services.

### Security & Identity Management

Security and identity solutions protect sensitive workloads while maintaining strict data control, tailored for the European cloud environment.

**CyberArk** plans to bring its AI-powered Identity Security Platform, applying intelligent privileged controls to human, machine, and AI identities—reducing operational and security risks via Zero Trust and Least Privilege with full visibility in a sovereign environment.

**Thales** is developing custom cloud-security offerings: CipherTrust Cloud Key Manager for key control, CipherTrust Data Security Platform for end-to-end data protection, Thales CIAM for secure user authentication, and Imperva WAAP to maintain data sovereignty at the application layer—helping customers protect sensitive data and comply while using cloud services safely.

**WithSecure** is creating a comprehensive, proactive cloud-native security solution with enhanced visibility and protection for European workloads, meeting stringent data-sovereignty requirements.

Partners are tailoring solutions to core digital-sovereignty needs—data residency, restricted operational access, resiliency, and survivability—so customers can build comprehensive, compliant environments suited to their unique requirements. As launch approaches, we’ll keep expanding partner collaborations to deliver more choice and capability. The priority region in Brandenburg, Germany—backed by a €7.8B investment—**shows our commitment to European digital sovereignty** and partner success.

Customers can start planning their move to AWS European Sovereign Cloud today by working with our partners and solution architects to design the right sovereign cloud architecture.

Together with partners, we’re building a future where European organizations can innovate confidently, knowing every digital-sovereignty requirement is met without compromise.
