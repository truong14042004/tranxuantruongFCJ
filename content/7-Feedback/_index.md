> Detailed feedback after the AWS internship (08/09/2025 – 09/12/2025) to help the FCJ/AWS team improve next cohorts:

### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
- Friendly, open; teammates respond quickly even off-hours when needed.  
- Workspace is tidy and quiet enough for labs and writing.  


**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
- Mentor explains clearly, encourages questions, lets me try first then reviews for deeper learning.  
- Admin handles access, paperwork, and docs quickly; reminds deadlines and helps schedule labs.  


**3. Relevance to Major**  
- Tasks align with Cloud/DevOps/AI background; added Security (IAM, guardrails) to round out the view.  
- Weekly pacing is reasonable with a clear roadmap, so no overload.

**4. Learning & Skill Development**  
- Technical: covered core cloud foundations, CI/CD, IaC, observability, and GenAI/ML.  
- Soft skills: reporting, demo presentations, balancing lab time and writing.  


**5. Culture & Team Spirit**  
- Respectful, collaborative, outcome- and learning-focused.  
- In urgent cases, everyone helps regardless of title.  
- Positive vibe makes it easy to ask for reviews and share blockers.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**  
- Flexible hours when needed.  
- Access to internal trainings and hands-on workshops (AI/ML, DevOps, Security).
